The btree_test package illustrates how btree may be used to build a simple test
program using a Fedora 19 development environment similar to that used for
hashdb.

Submodules btree/ and endian/ are from github.com/Beman.

Standard Boost is used from its standard Fedora package installation pint.

Various directories under btree_test/ test or demonstrate specific features.

For a starting example, please see directory string_index_set/ and its
Makefile.  The Makefile illustrates compilation and linkage requirements
and for simple usage of btree sets.
Running the program creates btree files "string_index_set.dat"
and "string_index_set.ndx" containing some entries that the test program
inserts.  Test program "string_index_set.cpp" was copied directly from
btree/example/string_index_set.cpp.
Test program string_index_set.cpp is described in section
"Variable length strings" in the tutorial at btree/doc/tutorial.html.

Please look at the other directories to see what they provide.


Downloading
-----------

Download the btree_test sources with git:

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/BruceMty/btree_test.git


Compiling
---------

cd to the directory of interest, and then type "make":

  $ make

Note that the Makefile is expected to be run on a Fedora 19 system
where a development environment, specifically g++ and Boost, are
already installed.
