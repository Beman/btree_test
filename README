test_btree illustrates how btree may be used to build a simple test program
using a Fedora development environment similar to that used for hashdb.

* Note that submodules btree and endian are from github.com/Beman.

* Note that standard Boost is used from its standard Fedora package
  installation pint.

Please see the Makefile for compilation and linkage requirements.

The Makefile simply compiles test program "string_index_set".
Running the program creates btree files "string_index_set.dat"
and "string_index_set.ndx" containing some entries that the test program
inserts.

Test program "string_index_set.cpp" was copied directly from
btree/example/string_index_set.cpp.

Test program string_index_set.cpp is described in section
"Variable length strings" in the tutorial at btree/doc/tutorial.html.


Downloading
-----------

Download the btree_test sources with git:

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/BruceMty/btree_test.git


Compiling
---------

  $ make

Note that the Makefile is expected to be run on a Fedora system
where a development environment, specifically g++ and Boost, are
already installed.
